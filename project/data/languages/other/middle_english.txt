1 In the bigynnyng God made of nouyt heuene and erthe.

2 Forsothe the erthe was idel and voide, and derknessis weren on the face of depthe; and the Spiryt of the Lord was borun on the watris.

3 And God seide, Liyt be maad, and liyt was maad.

4 And God seiy the liyt, that it was good, and he departide the liyt fro derknessis,

5 and he clepide the liyt, dai, and the derknessis, nyyt. And the euentid and morwetid was maad, o daie.

6 And God seide, The firmament be maad in the myddis of watris, and departe watris fro watris.

7 And God made the firmament, and departide the watris that weren vndur the firmament fro these watris that weren on the firmament; and it was don so.

8 And God clepide the firmament, heuene. And the euentid and morwetid was maad, the secounde dai.

9 Forsothe God seide, The watris, that ben vndur heuene, be gaderid in to o place, and a drie place appere; and it was doon so.

10 And God clepide the drie place, erthe; and he clepide the gadryngis togidere of watris, the sees. And God seiy that it was good;

11 and seide, The erthe brynge forth greene eerbe and makynge seed, and appil tre makynge fruyt bi his kynde, whos seed be in it silf on erthe; and it was doon so.

12 And the erthe brouyte forth greene erbe and makynge seed bi his kynde, and a tre makynge fruyt, and ech hauynge seed by his kynde. And God seiy that it was good.

13 And the euentid and morwetid was maad, the thridde dai.

14 Forsothe God seide, Liytis be maad in the firmament of heuene, and departe tho the dai and niyt; and be tho in to signes, and tymes, and daies, and yeeris;

15 and shyne tho in the firmament of heuene, and liytne tho the erthe; and it was doon so.

16 And God made twei grete liytis, the gretter liyt that it schulde be bifore to the dai, and the lesse liyt that it schulde be bifore to the niyt;

17 and God made sterris; and settide tho in the firmament of heuene, that tho schulden schyne on erthe,

18 and that tho schulden be bifore to the dai and nyyt, and schulden departe liyt and derknesse. And God seiy that it was good.

19 And the euentid and the morwetid was maad, the fourthe dai.

20 Also God seide, The watris brynge forth a `crepynge beeste of lyuynge soule, and a brid fleynge aboue erthe vndur the firmament of heuene.

21 And God made of nouyt grete whallis, and ech lyuynge soule and mouable, whiche the watris han brouyt forth in to her kyndis; and God made of nouyt ech volatile bi his kynde. And God seiy that it was good;

22 and blesside hem, and seide, Wexe ye, and be ye multiplied, and fille ye the watris of the see, and briddis be multiplied on erthe.

23 And the euentid and the morwetid was maad, the fyuethe dai.

24 And God seide, The erthe brynge forth a lyuynge soul in his kynde, werk beestis, and `crepynge beestis, and vnresonable beestis of erthe, bi her kyndis; and it was don so.

25 And God made vnresonable beestis of erthe bi her kyndes, and werk beestis, `and ech crepynge beeste of erthe in his kynde. And God seiy that it was good; and seide,

26 Make we man to oure ymage and liknesse, and be he souereyn to the fischis of the see, and to the volatilis of heuene, and to vnresonable beestis of erthe, and to ech creature, and to ech `crepynge beest, which is moued in erthe.

27 And God made of nouyt a man to his ymage and liknesse; God made of nouyt a man, to the ymage of God; God made of nouyt hem, male and female.

28 And God blesside hem, and seide, Encreesse ye, and be ye multiplied, and fille ye the erthe, and make ye it suget, and be ye lordis to fischis of the see, and to volatilis of heuene, and to alle lyuynge beestis that ben moued on erthe.

29 And God seide, Lo! Y haue youe to you ech eerbe berynge seed on erthe, and alle trees that han in hem silf the seed of her kynde, that tho be in to mete to you;

30 and to alle lyuynge beestis of erthe, and to ech brid of heuene, and to alle thingis that ben moued in erthe, and in whiche is a lyuynge soule, that tho haue to ete; and it was doon so.

31 And God seiy alle thingis whiche he made, and tho weren ful goode. And the euentid and morwetid was maad, the sixte day.

1 Therfor heuenes and erthe ben maad perfit, and al the ournement of tho.

2 And God fillide in the seuenthe dai his werk which he made; and he restide in the seuenthe dai fro al his werk which he hadde maad;

3 and he blesside the seuenthe dai, and halewide it; for in that dai God ceesside of al his werk which he made of nouyt, that he schulde make.

4 These ben the generaciouns of heuene and of erthe, in the day wherynne the Lord God made heuene and erthe,

5 and ech litil tre of erthe bifore that it sprong out in erthe; and he made ech erbe of the feeld bifore that it buriownede. For the Lord God had not reyned on erthe, and no man was that wrouyte erthe;

6 but a welle stiede out of the erthe, and moistide al the hiyere part of erthe.

7 Therfor the Lord God formede man of the sliym of erthe, and brethide in to his face the brething of lijf; and man was maad in to a lyuynge soule.

8 Forsothe the Lord God plauntide at the bigynnyng paradis of likyng, wherynne he settide man whom he hadde formed.

9 And the Lord God brouyte forth of the erthe ech tre fair in siyt, and swete to ete; also he brouyte forth the tre of lijf in the middis of paradis, and the tre of kunnyng of good and of yuel.

10 And a ryuer yede out fro the place of likyng to moyste paradis, which ryuer is departid fro thennus in to foure heedis.

11 The name of the o ryuer is Fyson, thilke it is that cumpassith al the lond of Euilath, where gold cometh forth,

12 and the gold of that lond is the beste, and there is foundun delium, that is, a tree of spicerie, and the stoon onychyn;

13 and the name to the secounde ryuer is Gyon, thilke it is that cumpassith al the loond of Ethiopie;

14 forsothe the name of the thridde ryuer is Tigris, thilke goith ayens Assiriens; sotheli the fourthe ryuer is thilke Eufrates.

15 Therfor the Lord God took man, and settide hym in paradis of likyng, that he schulde worche and kepe it.

16 And God comaundide to hym and seide, Ete thou of ech tre of paradis;

17 forsothe ete thou not of the tre of kunnyng of good and of yuel; for in what euere dai thou schalt ete therof, thou schalt die bi deeth.

18 And the Lord God seide, It is not good that a man be aloone, make we to hym an help lijk to hym silf.

19 Therfor whanne alle lyuynge beestis of erthe, and alle the volatils of heuene weren formed of erthe, the Lord God brouyte tho to Adam, that he schulde se what he schulde clepe tho; for al thing that Adam clepide of lyuynge soule, thilke is the name therof.

20 And Adam clepide bi her names alle lyuynge thingis, and alle volatils, and alle vnresonable beestis of erthe. Forsothe to Adam was not foundun an helpere lijk hym.

21 Therfore the Lord God sente sleep in to Adam, and whanne he slepte, God took oon of hise ribbis, and fillide fleisch for it.

22 And the Lord God bildide the rib which he hadde take fro Adam in to a womman, and brouyte hir to Adam.

23 And Adam seide, This is now a boon of my boonys, and fleisch of my fleisch; this schal be clepid virago, `for she is takun of man.

24 Wherfor a man schal forsake fadir and modir, and schal cleue to his wijf, and thei schulen be tweyne in o fleisch.

25 Forsothe euer eithir was nakid, that is, Adam and his wijf, and thei weren not aschamed.

1 But and the serpent was feller than alle lyuynge beestis of erthe, whiche the Lord God hadde maad. Which serpent seide to the womman, Why comaundide God to you, that ye schulden not ete of ech tre of paradis?

2 To whom the womman answerde, We eten of the fruyt of trees that ben in paradis;

3 sothely God commaundide to vs, that we schulden not eate of the fruyt of the tre, which is in the myddis of paradijs, and that we schulden not touche it, lest perauenture we dien.

4 Forsothe the serpent seide to the womman, ye schulen not die bi deeth;

5 for whi God woot that in what euere dai ye schulen ete therof, youre iyen schulen be opened, and ye schulen be as Goddis, knowynge good and yuel.

6 Therfore the womman seiy that the tre was good, and swete to ete, and fair to the iyen, and delitable in bi holdyng; and sche took of the fruyt therof, and eet, and yaf to hir hosebande, and he eet.

7 And the iyen of bothe weren openid; and whanne thei knowen that thei weren nakid, thei sewden the leeues of a fige tre, and maden brechis to hem silf.

8 And whanne thei herden the vois of the Lord God goynge in paradijs at the wynd after myddai, Adam and his wijf hidden hem fro the face of the Lord God in the middis of the tre of paradijs.

9 And the Lord God clepide Adam, and seide to hym, Where art thou?

10 And Adam seide, Y herde thi vois in paradijs, and Y drede, for Y was nakid, and Y hidde me.

11 To whom the Lord seide, Who forsothe schewide to thee that thou were nakid, no but for thou hast ete of the tre of which Y comaundide to thee that thou schuldist not ete?

12 And Adam seide, The womman which thou yauest felowe to me, yaf me of the tre, and Y eet.

13 And the Lord seide to the womman, Whi didist thou this thing? Which answerde, The serpent disseyued me, and Y eet.

14 And the Lord God seide to the serpent, For thou didist this, thou schalt be cursid among alle lyuynge thingis and vnresonable beestis of erthe; thou schalt go on thi brest, and thou schalt ete erthe in alle daies of thi liif;

15 Y schal sette enemytees bitwixe thee and the womman, and bitwixe thi seed and hir seed; sche schal breke thin heed, and thou schalt sette aspies to hir heele.

16 Also God seide to the womman, Y schal multiplie thi wretchidnessis and thi conseyuyngis; in sorewe thou schalt bere thi children; and thou schalt be vndur power of the hosebonde, and he schal be lord of thee.

17 Sothely God seyde to Adam, For thou herdist the voys of thi wijf, and hast ete of the tree, of which Y comaundide to thee that thou schuldist not ete, the erthe schal be cursid in thi werk; in traueylis thou schalt ete therof in alle daies of thi lijf;

18 it schal brynge forth thornes and breris to thee, and thou schalt ete eerbis of the erthe;

19 in swoot of thi cheer thou schalt ete thi breed, til thou turne ayen in to the erthe of which thou art takun; for thou art dust, and thou schalt turne ayen in to dust.

20 And Adam clepide the name of his wijf Eue, for sche was the moder of alle men lyuynge. And the Lord God made cootis of skynnys to Adam and Eue his wijf, and clothide hem; and seide, Lo!

22 Adam is maad as oon of vs, and knowith good and yuel; now therfore se ye, lest perauenture he putte his hond, and take of the tre of lijf, and ete, and lyue with outen ende.

23 And the Lord God sente hym out of paradijs of likyng, that he schulde worche the erthe, of which he was takun.

24 And God castide out Adam, and settide bifore paradis of lykyng cherubyn, and a swerd of flawme and turnynge aboute to kepe the weie of the tre of lijf.
1 Forsothe Adam knewe Eue his wijf, which conseyuede, and childide Cayn, and seide, Y haue gete a man bi God.2 And efte sche childide his brother Abel. Forsothe Abel was a kepere of scheep, and Cayn was an erthe tilyere.

3 Sotheli it was don after many daies, that Cayn offride yiftis to the Lord of the fruytis of erthe;4 and Abel offride of the first gendrid of his floc, and of the fatnesse of tho. And the Lord bihelde to Abel and to the yiftis of hym;5 sotheli he bihelde not to Cayn and to hise yiftis. And Cayn was wrooth greetli, and his cheer felde doun.

6 And the Lord seide to hym, Whi art thou wrooth, and whi felde doun thi face?7 Whether not if thou schalt do wel, thou schalt resseyue; but if thou doist yuele, thi synne schal be present anoon in the yatis? but the desir therof schal be vndur thee, and thou schalt be lord therof.

8 And Cayn seide to Abel his brother, Go we out. And whanne thei weren in the feeld, Cayn roos ayens his brother Abel, and killide him.

9 And the Lord seide to Cayn, Where is Abel thi brother? Which answerde, Y woot not; whether Y am the kepere of my brothir?10 And God seide to Cayn, What hast thou do? the vois of the blood of thi brother crieth to me fro erthe.11 Now therfor thou schalt be cursid on erthe, that openyde his mouth, and resseyuede of thin hond the blood of thi brothir.12 Whanne thou schalt worche the erthe, it schal not yyue his fruytis to thee; thou schalt be vnstable of dwellyng and fleynge aboute on erthe in alle the daies of thi lijf.

13 And Cayn seide to the Lord, My wickidnesse is more than that Y disserue foryyuenesse; lo!14 to dai thou castist me out fro the face of the erthe; and Y schal be hid fro thi face, and Y schal be vnstable of dwellyng and fleynge aboute in erthe; therfore ech man that schal fynde me schal slee me.15 And the Lord seide to hym, It schal not be don so, but ech man that schal slee Cayn shal be punyschid seuenfold. And the Lord settide a signe in Cayn, that ech man that schulde fynde hym schulde not slee hym.

16 And Cayn yede out fro the face of the Lord, and dwellide fleynge aboute in erthe, at the eest coost of Eden.17 Forsothe Cayn knewe his wiif, which conseyuede, and childide Enoth; and Cayn bildide a citee, and clepide the name therof of the name of hise sone Enoth.18 Forsothe Enoth gendride Irad, and Irad gendride Manyael, and Manyael gendride Matusael, and Matusael gendride Lameth;

19 that took twei wyues, the name to o wijf was Ada, and the name to the tother was Sella.20 And Ada gendride Jabel, that was the fadir of dwellers in tentis and of shepherdis;21 and the name of his brother was Tubal, he was the fadir of syngeris in harpe and orgun.22 And Sella gendride Tubalcayn, that was an hamerbetere, and smyyt on alle werkis of bras and of yrun; forsothe the sistir of Tubalcayn was Neoma.

23 And Lameth seide to his wyues Ada and Sella, Ye wyues of Lameth, here my vois, and herkne my word; for Y haue slayn a man bi my wounde, and a yong wexynge man bi my `violent betyng;24 veniaunce schal be youun seuenfold of Cayn, forsothe of Lameth seuentisithis seuensithis.

25 Also yit Adam knewe his wijf, and sche childide a sone, and clepide his name Seth, and seide, God hath put to me another seed for Abel, whom Cayn killide.26 But also a sone was borun to Seth, which sone he clepide Enos; this Enos bigan to clepe inwardli the name of the Lord.

1 This is the book of generacioun of Adam, in the dai wher ynne God made man of nouyt. God made man to the ymage and licnesse of God;2 God formede hem male and female, and blesside hem, and clepide the name of hem Adam, in the day in which thei weren formed.3 Forsothe Adam lyuede an hundrid yeer and thretti, and gendride a sone to his ymage and liknesse, and clepide his name Seth.4 And the daies of Adam after that he gendride Seth weren maad eiyte hundrid yeer, and he gendride sones and douytris.5 And al the tyme in which Adam lyuede was maad nyne hundrid yeer and thretti, and he was deed.

6 Also Seth lyuede an hundrid and fyue yeer, and gendride Enos.7 And Seth lyuede aftir that he gendride Enos eiyte hundrid and seuen yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.8 And alle the daies of Seth weren maad nyne hundrid and twelue yeer, and he was deed.9 Forsothe Enos lyuede nynti yeer, and gendride Caynan;10 aftir whos birthe Enos lyuede eiyte hundrid and fiftene yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.11 And alle the daies of Enos weren maad nyne hundrid and fyue yeer, and he was deed.12 Also Caynan lyuyde seuenti yeer, and gendride Malalehel.13 And Caynan lyuede after that he gendride Malalehel eiyte hundrid and fourti yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.14 And alle the dayes of Caynan weren maad nyn hundrid and ten yeer, and he was deed.15 Forsothe Malalehel lyuede sixti yeer and fyue, and gendride Jared.16 And Malalehel lyuede aftir that he gendride Jared eiyte hundrid and thretti yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.17 And alle the daies of Malalehel weren maad eiyte hundrid nynti and fyue yeer, and he was deed.18 And Jared lyuede an hundrid and two and sixti yeer, and gendride Enoth.19 And Jared lyuede aftir that he gendride Enoth eiyte hundrid yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.20 And alle the dayes of Jared weren maad nyn hundrid and twei and sexti yeer, and he was deed.

21 Forsothe Enoth lyuede fyue and sixti yeer, and gendride Matusalem.22 And Enoth yede with God; and Enoth lyuede after that he gendride Matusalem thre hundrid yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.23 And alle the daies of Enoth weren maad thre hundride and fyue and sexti yeer.24 And Enoth yeed with God, and apperide not afterward, for God took hym awei.

25 Also Matusalem lyuede an hundrid and `fourscoor yeer and seuene, and gendride Lameth.26 And Matusalem lyuede after that he gendride Lameth seuene hundrid and `fourscoor yeer and twei, and gendride sones and douytris.27 And alle the daies of Matusale weren maad nyn hundrid and nyn and sixti yeer, and he was deed.

28 Forsothe Lameth lyuede an hundrid and `fourscoor yeer and two, and gendride a sone;29 and clepide his name Noe, and seide, This man schal comforte vs of the werkis and traueilis of oure hondis, in the loond which the Lord curside.30 And Lameth lyuede after that he gendride Noe fyue hundrid `nynti and fyue yeer, and gendride sones and douytris.31 And alle the daies of Lameth weren maad seuene hundrid `thre scoor and seuentene yeer, and he was deed.32 Forsothe Noe whanne he was of fyue hundrid yeer gendride Sem, Cham, and Jafeth.
