  abstract  = "The cellular Potts model (CPM) is a powerful in silico method for simulating biological processes at tissue scale. Their inherently graphical nature makes CPMs very accessible in theory, but in practice, they are mostly implemented in specialised frameworks users need to master before they can run simulations. We here present Artistoo (Artificial Tissue Toolbox), a JavaScript library for building 'explorable' CPM simulations where viewers can change parameters interactively, exploring their effects in real time. Simulations run directly in the web browser and do not require third-party software, plugins, or back-end servers. The JavaScript implementation imposes no major performance loss compared to frameworks written in C++; Artistoo remains sufficiently fast for interactive, real-time simulations. Artistoo provides an opportunity to unlock CPM models for a broader audience: interactive simulations can be shared via a URL in a zero-install setting. We discuss applications in CPM research, science dissemination, open science, and education.",

	abstract = {T cells are among the most motile immune cells in the body, and their migration into and within tissues is key to their function. Remarkably, T cells can maintain their motility even in highly crowded environments like the densely packed T cell areas of lymphoid organs, but how they do so remains incompletely understood. Here, we use microfluidic devices and in silico models to study T cells from a crowd dynamics perspective, focusing on a hallmark scenario that has proven instrumental in characterizing other crowded systems such as pedestrians and ants: single-lane traffic. Unexpectedly, T cells in narrow, straight microchannels synchronize their speeds and form stable, motile trains. We show that this behavior can be explained by a preference of T cells to maintain contact with each other after collisions, and an ability of faster T cells to {\textquotedblleft}push{\textquotedblright} slower ones. We demonstrate that this behavior does not extend to all immune cells; neutrophils in the same settings slow down with increasing cell density. Cooperative motion may benefit T cell motility in difficult and crowded tissue environments, ultimately preventing jams that impair motion in other crowded systems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract = {Cell migration is a complex process involving many intracellular and extracellular factors, with different cell types adopting sometimes strikingly different morphologies. Modeling realistically behaving cells in tissues is computationally challenging because it implies dealing with multiple levels of complexity. We extend the Cellular Potts Model with an actin-inspired feedback mechanism that allows small stochastic cell rufflings to expand to cell protrusions. This simple phenomenological model produces realistically crawling and deforming amoeboid cells, and gliding half-moon shaped keratocyte-like cells. Both cell types can migrate randomly or follow directional cues. They can squeeze in between other cells in densely populated environments or migrate collectively. The model is computationally light, which allows the study of large, dense and heterogeneous tissues containing cells with realistic shapes and migratory properties.},

abstract = {Abstract The CIECAM02 color-appearance model enjoys popularity in scientific research and industrial applications since it was recommended by the CIE in 2002. However, it has been found that computational failures can occur in certain cases such as during the image processing of cross-media color reproduction applications. Some proposals have been developed to repair the CIECAM02 model. However, all the proposals developed have the same structure as the original CIECAM02 model and solve the problems concerned at the expense of losing accuracy of predicted visual data compared with the original model. In this article, the structure of the CIECAM02 model is changed and the color and luminance adaptations to the illuminant are completed in the same space rather than in two different spaces, as in the original CIECAM02 model. It has been found that the new model (named CAM16) not only overcomes the previous problems, but also the performance in predicting the visual results is as good as if not better than that of the original CIECAM02 model. Furthermore the new CAM16 model is simpler than the original CIECAM02 model. In addition, if considering only chromatic adaptation, a new transformation, CAT16, is proposed to replace the previous CAT02 transformation. Finally, the new CAM16-UCS uniform color space is proposed to replace the previous CAM02-UCS space. A new complete solution for color-appearance prediction and color-difference evaluation can now be offered.},

abstract = {The aggregate motion of a flock of birds, a herd of land animals, or a school of fish is a beautiful and familiar part of the natural world. But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},
